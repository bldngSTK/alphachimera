        <p><b>What is 'Worrying'?</b>
        Anything that our brain is capable of producing, it has evolved to produce for a good reason. 'Worrying' is our brain's hard-wired future-focused capacity that we use to predict, envision, consider, and forsee potential problems, dangers, or consequences (that haven't happened yet) and come up with solutions to prevent those problems and negative futures from actually happening.
        </p>
        <p><b>What causes 'Worrying'?</b>
            Worrying is caused by a lack of faith that 'things are going to be okay'. The sources of our suffering that have previously hurt us in learned early-life experiences fuel our worries, providing our mind with highly-specific and individualized anxious thoughts of how potential future circumstances can be altered by acting differently in relation to present circumstances, but all these worries are egocentric and focused around you as they're all centered around your own individual fears or insecurities ('I' might mess up, something bad might happen to 'me', something terrible might happen to 'my' child, etc.) and only get triggered by very particular circumstances. All of this insecure anxious worrying can be fundamentally rooted in a lack of confidence of the situation, or an inability to face the uncertainty of the situation. Confident people internally believe that failure is okay (because they can acknowledge all the reasons they failed that are outside of their control, thereby reducing blame and not feeling like 'the common denominator' since it's not all their fault), whereas unconfident people can be bent out-of-shape by failure since their black-and-white thinking was already feeling pretty uncertain if they could independently succeed (because of their past experiences and fears / insecurities) and the failure of today could end up affirming, assuring, and determining more future failures to come for them.</p>
        
        <p><b>Problematic Worrying</b>
            Although worrying can often be very helpful, calculative, protective, and preventative against undesirable outcomes, the process of worrying can sometimes unfortunately go haywire and start to become detrimental because as our mind tries to address one problem with a thought, it may thoughtfully generate another problem, sometimes starting a vicious cycle where one thought feeds into another thought which can then branch off to feed even more thoughts, eventually becoming so overwhelming that we may feel like distracting ourselves, addictively seeking reassurance, avoiding the situation entirely, or even make us start a war where our logical mind starts fighting with our emotionally anxious mind. Anxiety may seem like a very disastrous and damaging over-reaction to the consequences of suffering from past experiences, but anytime our body or mind is faced with a challenge, they always do the best that they can with the given circumstances they are in to deal with the suffering as effectively as possible, but it may not always deal with the injury perfectly. With our physical body, if I break an arm or leg, my body does the best it can to naturally heal and reform the broken limb, but if I don't use something like a brace, splint, or cast, my 'healed' limb will be a little bent and crooked, and I'll be a little bit disabled going forward. Similarly, our mind naturally does a lot of things to deal with our anxiety, but the natural reactions aren't always perfectly optimized in all ways, and anxiety is the result of our mind being a bit bent and crooked moving forward from the negative past-experience.
