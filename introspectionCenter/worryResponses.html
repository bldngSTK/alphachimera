        <p>
            When we feel worried, the most natural ways we respond to that feeling is by Distracting from, Removing Uncertainty from, and Fighting with the anxiety. While all of the 3 instinctive responses can seem like useful short-term solutions, unfortunately all of these responses can start to be extremely problematic and can leave us worse-off in the long run compared to when we started. Understanding and gaining awareness of the way we normally and naturally respond to anxiety can help us start to control and change it, and knowing what we're doing can help us catch it in the act and manually choose healthier ways to deal with it.
        </p>
          <p><b>Distraction:</b>
            Worrying is the future-focused mind, and we've instinctively learned how to shift and engage our mind's direction from the future to the present (with videogames, binging TV shows, internet videos, etc). As we get lost in forms of distraction and entertainment, the worry and anxious thoughts can start to fade into the background. While distraction can allow us to temporarily take a break from our worried mind and suppress our immediate suffering, the cost of distraction can be quite high in the long run as we may find ourselves back in the same place once the distraction ends, because we didn't actually do anything to definitively deal with those potential future problems our anxiety was warning us about when we were distracting ourselves, causing all the worry to fade right back in.

            <h5 align="middle"><p>What were you worried about and what did you distract yourself with? When you were done distracting<br>yourself, did the intensity of your anxiety increase or decrease? What ended up happening after the<br>event you were worried about was over?

            <h6 align="middle"><p>Ex: I was worried about taking a test I was supposed to study weeks for, but on the last couple days before the test when I still could've crammed,<br>I instead distracted myself with videogames the whole weekend. After I turned off my videogames and went to bed, I couldn't sleep because I was<br>worrying about the exam for hours, the intensity of the anxiety increased 10-fold. After I took the test, I felt relieved it was over and didn't think<br>about it for a while, but then I ended up getting an F on the test and felt really ashamed when I remembered what happened. Distracting myself<br>with videogames was not worth it.</p></h6>

            <p><b>Removing Uncertainty:</b>
            Worrying is all about uncertainty with 'If's and 'might's, and anxious thoughts are often structured like a series of 'if-then' statements with the end-goal of trying to protect us or prevent some kind of negative consequence.
            ("<u>If</u> I go to the party, <u>then</u> people <u>might</u> make fun of me", "<u>If</u> I ask my boss for a promotion, <u>then</u> they <u>might</u> think I'm greedy", "<u>If</u> I ask my professor for an extension, <u>then</u> they <u>might</u> think I'm lazy", etc). Removing the uncertainty in the short-term can get rid of the anxiety entirely, and the 2 ways remove uncertainty is through Avoidance (removes 'If-then's) and through Seeking Reassurance (removes 'might's).</p>
    
            <p><u>Avoidance</u> is avoiding the event/circumstances entirely to guarantee the certainty of no consequences ("If I go to the party, then people might make fun of me, so I won't go", "If I ask my boss for a promotion, then they might think I'm greedy, so I won't ask", "If I request my professor for an extension, then they might think I'm lazy, so I won't request the extension, etc"). Even though we can alleviate our worry with avoidance, we buy that alleviation at the price of our freedom, leading to a very restricted life and losing control of our life to the anxiety, potentially causing us to miss out on things that may be good for us as well.</p>
            <p><u>Seeking Reassurance</u> is looking for external data to reassure us for sure that our own anxious thoughts are incorrect, making sure the 'might' becomes a 'won't'. ("If I go to the party, people might make fun of me, but if I check that there's someone at the party I can talk to so that I know for sure that I won't look like a lonely loser that can get made fun of, then I can go to the party", "If I ask my professor for an extension, they might think I'm lazy, but if I sneakily ask my TA and other students if it's normal to ask for an extension so that I know for sure that the professor won't think I'm lazy, then I can ask for the extension"). Even though seeking reassurance can be a temporary solution, over-time we can become dependent on constantly going to these external sources of reassurance to temporarily calm our worry down and make us feel secure. That high dosage of relief we feel after we get obtain the reassurance can positively reinforce the behavior of 'seeking reassurance' everytime we're worried. When people who feel anxious take an anxiolytic medication (pill that makes anxiety go away), over-time that actually reinforces popping pills any time we're anxious, and seeking reassurance can serve as addictively 'popping a pill' for anxiety.</p>

            <h5 align="middle"><p>- If you used Avoidance, add at the end ", so I didn't ____". By restricting your actions, what experience did it cause you to miss out on? What did the avoidance protect you from? Looking back, was it worth it?<br>- If you used Seeking Reassurance, add at the end ", but if I ____ so that I know for sure that ____, then I can ____." Over time, do you find yourself becoming more dependant or less dependant on reassurance whenever you're worried? </p></h6>

            <p><b>Fighting our Mind:</b>
                Sometimes we may push ourselves into mentally overcoming our worry, and a war erupts in our mind between our emotional side that feels anxious, and our logical mind that thinks "We shouldn't feel this way, it's illogical", and we realize how irrational our anxiety can be, so we try to argue, fight, and bully our anxiety into going away. But the more we force our mind to enter tranquility, the less natural it feels, causing us to create and dump more tension, energy, and conflict into our mind, which then moves further away from a tranquil state of mind, inadvertently fueling the anxiety even further. (Ex: Sleep anxiety is when you try to go to sleep and but a small part of you starts worrying about how you really need to wake up tomorrow, and the more you start to think about how you need to go to bed and beat yourself up for not sleeping yet, the more your anxious thoughts start looping and moving you away from the tranquility required to enter sleep, thereby creating a vicious insomnia-inducing cycle). Even when we fight, some days the logical side wins and we fearlessly take action, but the anxiety still sits in the background at the same intensity over time and can be triggered next time the circumstances are similar, making us feel like we need to fight that exhausting battle again. We're fighting our own mind, and when we fight against ourself, every win we have also comes with a loss.

            <h5 align="middle"><p>What were you worried about and how exactly did you fight with your anxious mind? As you fought your anxiousness, did you notice the fighting caused an increase in the<br>tension of your mind thereby making the anxiety more intense, or did your anxiousness actually decrease the more you fought it? Who ended up winning, you or your<br>anxiety? After you fought with your mind, did you feel relaxed or tired? The next time around, did the strength of your anxiety get better or worse?</p></h6>

            <h6 align="middle"><p>Ex: I was worried about going to a party because I thought other people might judge me and scrutizine me if they think I'm strange or weird, so my anxious mind<br>wanted me to remove the uncertainty of that potentially happening by avoiding the party all-together. But I thought of how stupid it was for me to feel worried about<br>going to party where everyone is there to hang out and have fun, and I thought of how unreasonable and irrational it was for me to not go. Then I started to fight with<br>my worried thoughts, arguing with it by saying things like "They won't care if I come off as weird", "Even if I am weird, they'll forget about it anyways","God I'm<br>such a worrywart", etc. Eventually I ended up 'beating' my anxiety and going to the party, but I found that I was mentally exhausted and worn-out by fighting my own anxiety.<br>To make matters worse, I found that next time I was invited to another party, all the anxiety that I had worked so hard to conquer the first time had just come roaring back.</p></h6>
