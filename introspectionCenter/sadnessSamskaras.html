        <h1 align="middle">Systems of Sadness</h1> <!--~~~~~S1H at top of each section~~~~~-->
        <p>The different styles and systems of how sadness affects our lives can vary drastically per person, because not everyone's experience of sadness is the same and each person's sadness is unique and different to them. The big reason these maladaptive systems of sadness exist is because our mind often prefers the confidently-survived 'familiar' over the uncertain 'good'. 5 of the most common experiences of sadness are: Regret-Induced Paralysis, Conditional Value, Misdirected Blame, Defensive Hopelessness, and Falling Behind.</p><br>
        
        <p class="S1H"><b>Regret-Induced Paralysis</b></p>
        <p>A mind filled with sadness focuses on dwelling in regret and is not okay with the outcomes of their past actions ("I made mistakes and screwed up, things would've been better if I hadn't XYZ"). These regrets then cause us to have a firmly negative self-opinion and identity of ourself, because our identity is formed by the way we conceptualize the past and 'someone who's made these mistakes in the past becomes this kind of person in the present' (Ex: "Because I failed to graduate from highschool in the past, I am a lazy worthless person today", even though it was only 1 failure of the past, the outcomes of past actions become an identity I carry forward in the present). The 2 qualities of this negative identity come with a sense of worthlessness (feeling like you don't have intrinsic value) and powerlessness (feeling like we don't have the ability to change anything, because 'If I did have that power, I wouldn't have made those mistakes in the first place').</p>
        <p>A sense of hopelessness can then form from combining the sense of worthlessness and powerlessness, because if "I'm someone who doesn't have value" and "I'm powerless to change things", naturally my future becomes dark and hopeless. Even though hopelessness and worry have to do with the future, 'worrying' is the future-focused mind filled with uncertainty, whereas 'hopelessness' is a certainly negative future defined by the disappointments of the past, 'the future is determined by who I am right now, which is in-turn determined by what I've evidently done in the past.' Hopelessness causes our motivation to decrease because the actions that we have motivation towards are the actions we believe are 'worth it' with a high likelihood of success, but if our mind believes "I'm a powerless person" and "I don't have value", then it can produce hopeless thoughts like "It's not gonna work" or "It's not worth it since you're not worth much anyway and can't actually change anything." As long as we have a sense of hopelessness from worthlessness and powerlessness, our motivation won't increase, so reconceptualizing past regrets can create a change in our present identity, and once we believe "I can do it" and "I have value", our hopelessness melts away and our motivation unlocks because now our mind says "It's worth it."</p>

        <h6 align="middle"><p>Ex: There was one time I was very unmotivated to study for a Biology exam. This motivation towards studying Biology was reduced by hopelessness because I felt like there was no point in studying and studying felt like a drag and very tiring.<br>My hopeless thoughts were "Studying won't work", "There's no point in studying", "You are wasting so much time and energy studying". This hopelessness was fueled by worthlessness because I felt like I was a terrible student and a bad learner<br>since I've failed so many exams and suck at paying attention in class, and also fueled by powerlessness because I felt like no matter how hard I tried I could never get the information to sink in when studying and I can never focus on studying well<br>enough. This sense of worthlessness and powerlessness was fueled by my past regrets that caused unideal outcomes because one time I tried studied but I kept getting bored and played videogames instead making me fail the test, and another<br>time I tried studying but even though I studied for dozens of hours more than necessary, I still ended up failing the test. These 2 regrettable actions made me feel like I was the common denominator and made me feel worthless that I was<br>a terrible student and powerless that I couldn't study well enough, which then combined into hopelessness towards studying.</p></h6>

        <p class="S2H"><b>Conditional Value</b></p>
        <p>One frequent experience of sadness is feeling worthless, and some people can be taught to believe 'My intrinsic worth and value as a person is conditional and dependant on my performance'. This can become problematic because if we believe 'My value as a human being depends on how I perform' and then we mess up making some kind of mistake, then we can start to think very lowly of ourself and lose faith in ourself, and this low sense of self-confidence can make us feel like fixing the problem is hopeless. This hopelessness then makes our performance even more worse, which causes us to lose faith in ourself even further, making us feel trapped in a vicious cycle of 'I screwed up, so I'm worthless, and I can't do anything, so I'm screwing up even harder, and I'm even more worthless.' Normally when things don't go our way, that's when we need to have faith in ourself to work twice as hard, but if we believe 'My value depends on how well I do', a single mistake can start a cycle of worthlessness and failures.
        </p>
        <p>Formative past experiences when growing up (oftentimes parental upbringing and societal norms) can condition us to believe 'My value as a human being depends on how well I perform'. Growing up, we may have noticed that our parents (like tiger parents who think about their kids as their trophies) may actually love us very conditionally based on how we performed, excessively showering us with praise and bragging about us to others if we performed well, but then also being very disappointed, ashamed, and upset with us if we performed poorly, the opposite of unconditional love (with unconditional love, although our parent's approval of us as a child is still somewhat influenced by our behavior where our parent tries to positively reinforce and reward our good behaviors while discouraging our bad behaviors, underlying our parent's actions is always a complete sense of unconditional acceptance where 'No matter how bad I behave, my parent will still love me and I will never lose my value'.) Growing up, we also may have also noticed that our culture, societal norms, or even social media were heavily caught up in ranking people's value, worth, and social statuses based on external performance measures like the 'prestigiousness of career', reputability of educational institution', or 'how rich we are'. In the same way our mind was taught to believe the lesson of "I'm worthless because I didn't do a good job and my value depends on how well I do" from particular experiences, we can also unlearn this lesson by going back and digesting and reconceptualizing these experiences with a new nuance. The more we digest these experiences, the less these thoughts of worthlessness bubble up, and then we find ourself able to take action more easily because we realize 'You don't have to be the best since you still have value, and you just need to do something to take one step forward.'</p>
        <h4 align="middle" class="S2Q">Write about a time you felt like your value as a person was determined by how well you do.</h4>
        <h5 align="middle"><p>What were you expected to do well at to be considered 'valuable', and what ended up determining your worth?<br>How long have you felt like your intrinsic value was was determined by this, and what caused you to believe<br>your were only considered valuable if you did well at this but worthless if you didn't do well at it?<br>What event triggered the worthlessness, and how has that affected your hopelessness in-turn affecting<br>your motivation?

The worthlessness was triggered when I failed<br>my 10th grade final exam (because I didn't study since I believed I was a smart kid and studying was for stupid kids), and this worthlessness made me<br>feel like a was an idiot, making me feel hopeless about continuing school, and this affected my motivation by making me drop out of highschool entirely.<br>I can reconceptualize the past of learning that 'My worth was determined by how smart I was' from seeing my parents being overly proud of only my smartness<br>by recognizing that my parents were simply being super excited about me joining the Gifted Kids program and them only praising me about my intelligence<br>doesn't necessarily mean anything about my worth as a human if I do stupid things because I still have value regardless of whether I'm smart or stupid.</p></h6>

<p class="S3H"><b>Misdirected Blame</b></p>
<p>Sadness is strongly tied to blame because blaming ourself leads to regret and shame and blaming other people leads to hurt and resentment. The common element to a lot of sadness is blame and the solution to blame is forgiveness, so once we fairly assign blame and then forgive accordingly a lot of our sadness goes away. Unfortunately we often unfairly misdirect blame from the right target to the wrong target to avoid negative emotions, causing us to never truly forgive the right target and prolonging the sadness even further. Anytime we blame someone, the target of our blame should be those with the responsibility and control over the situation that caused the negative outcome to happen, but sometimes we improperly misdirect blame where we blame ourself even though we should be blaming other people, or we blame other people when we should actually be blaming ourself.</p>
<p>We unfairly misdirect blame to other people instead of to ourself to protect ourself from blame since we don't want to be the ones at fault. This can be problematic because the ones who are to blame are the ones who have the power to fix the issue, but if we keep blaming other people when its actually our fault, we inadvertently give away our license to power and control over the problem, making the cause of the problem never get understood. A part of us may also know 'it's actually my fault', but if we never truly blame ourself, we never get the chance to forgive ourself, making us silently hold on to that regret and sadness longer. Once we shamefully admit 'It's not other people's fault and I am actually the cause of this problem' but then we manage to forgive ourself, all that sadness melts away.</p>

<p>On the flip-side, we sometimes unfairly blame ourself instead of blaming other people which can be frustrating because if it's not truly our fault, the problem can feel impossible to fix since we don't actually have the power to fix it, and we may think we have control but we feel powerless since it wasn't even our fault to begin with. The first reason we unfairly blame ourself is because we get repeatedly conditioned to believe 'If something goes wrong, it's my fault' from various experiences where other people protect themselves from blame by unfairly shifting it onto us. (Ex: Our teacher may tell us 'It's your fault you're failing the class' when the teacher is doing a bad job teaching, our boss may tell us "It's your fault we lost the contract" when the boss made bad business decisions that caused the loss, etc.) The more we accumulate these unprocessed lessons, the more the belief of 'It's my fault' gets triggered anytime things go badly, making us blame ourself when its not even our fault. Going back to digest those emotional memories by understanding the actual nuance behind 'why things happened the way they did' reduces the frequency of those self-blaming thoughts and melts our sadness.</p>
<p>The second reason we unfairly blame ourself is to protect the people we're supposed to blame. When someone we care about does something wrong, we may feel like we're ungrateful, disrespectful, uncompassionate, and guilty for blaming them, making us sometimes justify their actions ('They did the best that they could') while never properly acknowledging the negatives ('But they still didn't do a good job'.) It may be hard for us to admit how their mistakes made us disappointed, but by never acknowledging that we also restrict ourself from forgiving them and moving on from the sadness. Some part of us still feels hurt and resentful by their actions but we push that down to protect them instead of blaming them. The real way to grow from this sadness is by truly blaming them with how what they did was wrong (which lets out the hurt and anger) but still forgiving them after that(which lets us move on from the sadness).</p>
<p>The reason we unfairly misdirect blame from the proper target in the first place is to avoid negative emotions. Once we decide to blame ourself after unfairly blaming other people, we may be flooded by shame, and once we blame other people after unfairly blaming ourself, we may feel guilty, ungrateful, and resentful. The avoidance from all the pent-up negative emotion can burden us with sadness, and in order to clean out that sadness, we first need to direct blame towards the proper target. Once we process the shame or ungratefulness, we can try to understand the nuances of who was really in control for causing the bad situation to happen, which can help us forgive and move past sadness.</p>

<h4 align="middle" class="S3Q">Write about a time when an undesired outcome happened but then you misdirected blame incorrectly, whether that be unfairly towards yourself or unfairly towards other people.</h4>
<h5 align="middle"><p>What is the undesired outcome that happened, and what would've been the ideally desired outcome? Did you blame yourself for why the undesired outcome happened or did you blame other people as the cause?<br><br>If you chose to blame yourself, do you really have the control and power to prevent the problem from happening again, or does the problem feel impossible to fix because you're actually not at fault?<br>Do you blame yourself because you believe 'When something goes wrong, it's my fault' or because you are protecting someone else from all the blame by putting it all on yourself instead of on them?<br><br>If you believe 'When something goes wrong, it's my fault', what are some other factors you can acknowledge that might've influenced this negative outcome to happen the way it did?<br>Write about some experience where people told you 'It's your fault' even though it might've not been. Include nuance of all factors that could've contributed to this negative outcome.<br><br>If you blame yourself to protect someone else from the blame, who are you refusing to blame and what is the bad thing they did to cause the negative outcome to eventually happen?<br>How does your mind decide to try justifying their bad behavior without ever truly acknowledging the negatives of how bad they acted and how much they ended up disappointed you?<br>Once we try to start blaming them for all their negative actions, do you start feeling like you're being ungrateful, disrespectful, and 'just complaining'?

<p class="S4H"><b>Defensive Hopelessness</b></p>
<p>Sometimes we may intellectually know exactly what we should and need to do (we have all our hopes, dreams, aspirations, and ideas figured out), but we still just can't seem to bring ourself to do it. We may feel like we're stuck in a meaningless limbo and really want things like 'motivation' or 'discipline' to fix our inability to act. But underneath our inability to do stuff may not be a problem with 'motivation' and 'discipline', but can instead be an issue of hopelessness where 'there's no point in trying because nothing will succeed'. We often think of hopelessness as a problem that paralyzes us and wonder 'how can I just learn to hope again so I can just act', but hopelessness can oftentimes actually be a solution, because hopelessness is an impervious shield that protects us from rejection and failure ('As long as I don't have hope, I won't try, and as long as I don't try, I can't fail'). We may logically think 'I don't want to be hopeless, if I have hope I can go do things', but our emotionally-fueled mind thinks 'I can either be hopeless where I don't try and then there's just a safe hypothetical failure, or I can really try giving it my all but then there's a real danger that I could actually fail'.</p>
<p>The root cause of this defensive hopelessness is some emotionally-charged experience in our past where we really gave it our all and risked things for the sake of succeeding and achieving a particular desired outcome but then we fell short and get crushed with failure so hard that we end up learning 'I can either not try and be stuck in limbo with just a possibility of future failure, or I can actually go out and try and then the failure becomes real'. Once we digest these past emotional experiences and reconceptualize how things happened, we can start mustering up the courage to be more okay with failure and be more ready and prepared with what to do if we do end up failing. But the unfortunate problem with people who struggle with 'Defensive Hopelessness' is that even if we do become okay with failure and start to act, we may start to feel like succeeding can hurt even more than failure because we feel like we've heavily fallen behind.</p>
<h4 align="middle" class="S4Q">Write about a time when you knew what you should do but felt hopeless about doing it.</h4>
<h5 align="middle"><p>Describe your present situation, what kind of limbo are you stuck in right now? What do you know you should do but<br>just can't act on, and what kind of hopeless thoughts prevent you from acting? What kind of rejections and failures are<br>the hopeless thoughts protecting you from, and what's so bad about these rejections and failures that makes them so<br>painful that you need to protect yourself from it (Would you rather be stuck in your current limbo or experience those<br>rejections and failures?) Now describe a past experience where you tried really hard to achieve some desired outcome but<br>still ended up getting crushed and falling short failing, how can you reconceptualize how this past event happened? Now how can<br>you plan ahead and be more prepared for dealing with the future potential failures your hopeless thoughts are protecting you from?</p>
<textarea class="S4A" rows="5" cols="27" align="middle"type="text"></textarea><br> <!--every answer has class="S1A" --> 
<h6 align="middle"><p>Ex: I'm currently a 25-year-old college dropout and stuck in a limbo where I play videogames all day in my mom's basement. I want to be a doctor and I know<br>I should go to some kind of college or community college to get a medical education, but the hopeless thoughts that prevent me from acting say things like<br>'There's no point in applying to college, applying won't work'. The failure that my hopeless thoughts protect me is the outcome of 'Me applying to community<br>college as a 25-year-old and still getting rejected or not being able to persist', and this outcome is terrible because it would be pathetic, painful, and super shameful<br>if I still fail to get accepted or complete college after setting the bar so low, and I would rather be stuck in my mom's basement and play videogames all day than<br>experience something so pathetic and ashaming. When I was 18, I tried my hardest to get into Harvard University and decided to try to spend weeks perfecting<br>my application and risk so much to the point where I didn't apply to any other college, but I ended up not failing to get accepted and felt absolutely defeated,<br>and I applied to some community college near my area last minute (I shortly dropped out and moved in to my mom's basement). I can reconceptualize this event by<br>learning from my narrowness of applying and being more willing to apply to multiple colleges rather than completely bet on one college application. I can plan<br>ahead with 'failing to get into or finish community college as a 25-year-old' by applying to various different colleges and community colleges because that can<br>significantly increase my chances of getting accepted, and even if I get rejected or can't handle the workload I can still<br>keep applying to different ones until one of the colleges accepts me and I finish successfully.</p></h6>

<p class="S5H"><b>Falling Behind</b></p>

<p>One common source of sadness is the persistent feeling of having 'fallen behind', where we feel like everyone else is moving on but we're unable to 'catch up'. This sense of falling behind starts from 'the problem of escalating impossibility' where we plan to solve a problem but don't start early enough, and the more time passes by, the more impossible it feels to fix the problem, eventually making us heavily regret not starting earlier (Ex: When we have a test in a month we need to study 30 hours of content for, we may start off thinking 'I'll just need to study 1 hour a day for the rest of the month and I'll be fine', but we never actually start and keep distracting ourself from it and procrastinate thinking 'It's okay if I miss some days, 1.25 hours a day is still super manageable'. Each day that goes by where we don't study yet, the panic grows a little more, and we may find ourself in a vicious cycle where the more the panic and negative emotions we feel, the harder it becomes to start studying because we keep procrastinating and distracting ourself, and we eventually reach a point where we need to study 10+ hours a day and it starts to feel impossible, making us feel a lot of regret for not starting earlier. After we take the exam, we feel a ton of instant relief and distract ourself instead of looking back on the test, so all of that negative emotion of panic and regret for not starting earlier goes dormant in the back of our mind.) Anytime we face these problems of escalating impossibility where 'I was capable of doing something but wasn't able live up to it' and it stays unprocessed, we can start to silently learn this belief of 'I've fallen behind'. Furthermore, we may try to selectively look for biased logical evidence and reasoning to convince ourself that 'I am indeed justified to feel like I've fallen behind', where we selectively compare ourselves to other people who we believe are in the same league as us in some way but are 'better than us' in some aspects while unfairly ignoring all the negative qualities of those people. We may think our emotional belief of 'fallen behind' is a logical unbiased conclusion from various evidence, but the belief of 'I've fallen behind' came first, and then we biasely scan for selectively logical evidence to support that belief with thoughts like 'I'm so far behind person because they're smarter than me, I'm so far behind person because they're richer than me, etc', all for the sake of convincing ourself that 'I am someone who's fallen behind'.</p>
<p>Once we successfully become conviced by our biased mind that 'I'm someone who's fallen behind', our mind then starts telling us to 'catch up', and 'the further behind we've fallen', the more important it is to 'catch up', but we're never able to do so because 'catching up' is a terrible way to move forward since  it's and action wrapped in an expectation and can be very paralyzing. If we've 'fallen behind' and our goal is to 'catch up', any time we take a step in the right direction, we feel like 'it's 'not enough, so why bother?', because the bigger the mountain we need to climb is, the more insignificant any step towards our goal becomes, so we're not able to follow through. The actions we need to take to move forward, irrespective of whether we are 'behind' or not, will always be exactly the same regardless of where our end-goal is, but if our goal is to 'catch up', any step we take becomes really hard to repeat because it feels like we're not making progress. The key to making progress in the right direction is to let go of these mental constructions of 'catching up' and 'falling behind' and simply move forward.</p>
<p>The reason it's so hard to let go of 'catching up' and 'fallen behind' is because letting go of 'catching up' means letting go of the fantasy of 'glorious triumph', and the key to fixing the sadness and shame caused by 'falling behind' is to let go of these ideas of 'catching up' and 'the fantasy of being mangificently triumphant against all odds', because reality is what it is and all these mental constructions of 'falling behind', 'catching up', these thoughts of 'triumphant redemption fantasy' and 'Any step you take is not enough, so don't bother' are simply layered on top of reality and make it harder to act. Once we realize 'Action can only be taken in the present and moving forward may never let me catch up but it's okay if I don't catch up, all I need to do is move forward', thats when our sadness and shame goes away and we can act freely.</p>
<h4 align="middle" class="S5Q">Write about a time you felt ashamed because you were convinced that you've 'fallen behind' and really wanted to 'catch up', but felt like 'any action I take isn't enough'.</h4>

<h6 align="middle"><p>Ex: On a scale from 1-10, my desire to catch up is at a 9. I want to catch up so that I can outweigh all the times I've failed and fallen behind and prove my parents wrong. I triumphantly fantasize about catching up by becoming the leader of the school's<br>football team and having everyone shower me with praise after every game. By catching up, I want to be better than my friend Joe who's my mom keeps saying is better than me at sports. In order to catch up, I first need to lose about 100 pounds because<br>I am very overweight right now and would never pass the tryouts for the football team. Anytime I go to the gym, I feel hopeless to continue following through with going to the gym because I barely end up losing any weight after my workout session and<br>it feels like an impossibly progress to keep making, so I end up not continuing to exercise and go back to my room and play videogames, and I am not able to continue catching up because it feels like my progress is small and insignificant. In order to convince<br>me that I've 'fallen behind', my mind compared me to Joe, Jake, Logan, and Tyler. Joe is better than me because he goes to the gym everyday, but is worse than me because he is an abusive boyfriend. Jake is better than me because he is very muscular and ripped,<br>but worse than me because everyone hates him. Logan is better than me because he has more agility and speed than me when he runs, but is worse then me because he runs a secret illegal business to scam other students.  Tyler is better than me because he has more<br>endurance, stamina, and makes more money than me, but is worse than me because he doesn't know how to cook. One time my class had a schoolplay in 4th grade that would be performed in front of a bunch of parents. My role was the lion and I only had about 8 lines<br>to memorize over the course of the month so I decided to memorize about 2 lines a week. I decided to procrastinate because I only had 8 lines and could cram a little if I want. 3 days before performance day I finally looked at my lines and saw that it was way longer than I<br>thought even though it was still just 8 lines. I couldn't remember them at all and I panicked and regretted not looking at the lines earlier. Performance day came and I messed up my lines but then pretending like nothing happened and went backstage, and the parents watching<br>were really confused and the teacher was mad, I felt really ashamed for not starting earlier. I thought I could easily memorize the lines but I ended up not being able to. Afterwards I immediately went to my friends house and played videogames with him to forget.<br>The actions I can devote myself to are going to the gym at a reasonable pace tailored to me, and if I never get into the football team, so be it, I'm doing the best that I can.
