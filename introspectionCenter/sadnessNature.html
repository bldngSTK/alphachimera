        <p><b>What is 'Sadness'?</b>Negative emotions are often seen as something that needs to be avoided or suppressed, with people oftentimes distracting themselves from feeling negative emotions with avoidance behaviors or addictively pleasuring distractions. However, the whole reason every single human being is given the ability and capability of even experiencing negative emotions in the first place is because they are incredibly adaptive and serve a very important purpose. Sadness is when the mind dwells in the past and gets caught up in some kind of expectation or 'idealness' that did not get met in the past. Whether it be an unment external expectation (like Disappointment or Dismay) or unment internal expectations of the self (like Regret, Guilt, or Shame), the common sentiment of all sadness is "I'm not okay with how things went".</p>
        <p><b>What causes 'Sadness'?</b>
        Sadness and dissatisfaction with our actions can serve as a strong compass of moving our actions towards the right direction to help us grow as people. The more we feel, follow, and try to correct our dissatisfaction and sadness (that we have with particular actions or circumstances), the more we can move towards the right circumstances and actions to where we end up satisfied of meeting our expectations.
        The Default Mode Network (DMN) is the circuit in our brain that grants humans the capacity of self-awareness, and the biggest neuroscientific difference between humans and animals is that humans have a DMN that lets us think about how our own actions can influence the external world.
        When an animal without a DMN attempts a task and fails, it simply thinks 'That's unlucky' and continues mindlessly repeating it's actions without changing it's strategy until it succeeds. But when a human fails at a task, we may initially think 'That's unlucky, let's try again', but at some point our brain's capacity of 'self-reflection on action's outcome' starts producing thoughts like 'Maybe I am doing something wrong here', 'Maybe I am being an idiot', 'Is there some way I can change my strategy to prevent this negative outcome from reoccuring?'. Even if the animal and human are given the same exact task, the animal doesn't think 'I keep failing so maybe I'm doing something wrong' and instead just continues to think it keeps getting unlucky. 
Furthermore, animals don't change their sense-of-identity if they fail at a task, but even though the human's outcome at a task doesn't necessarily say anything about who they are as a person, humans have the ability to reflect on a past outcome (like failing/succeeding) and then adopt a respective identity for themselves in the present based on those past outcome ("I am a failure", "I am smart", etc).
        The ability to create and carry an identity in the present based on the outcomes resulting from actions we did in the past comes from the DMN, and this same ability of not writing everything up as "luck" and being able to think about how we may be responsible for the outcomes of certain actions is mainly what allowed humans to dominate this planet compared to other animals, because once we become responsible for something, then we can have the power to change it. Unfortunately sometimes the DMN can also become inappropriately maladaptive and hyper-active, making people stuck thinking negative things about themselves by hyperfocusing on how they influenced something going a particular way, trying to blame them into feeling responsible for everything happening and making them feel like everything is their fault, often overwhelming them with regret and shame.</p>
