        <p>Whenever we feel emotions, we can sometimes get caught up in how strong and intense the effect of the emotion can feel, and we oftentimes forget that the effect of emotion is really only limited to our physical body. More specifically, emotions that manifest in our body are usually felt along the body-parts along our spine (headache, blushing cheeks, tightness is throat, tightness in chest, butterflies in stomache, etc.) There is a specific meditative breathing technique that takes advantage of this fact and weakens the effect of emotions on our body and mind with the help of the breath. This technique involves identifying where specifically the emotion is felt most prominently in our body, breathing fresh air into this part of the body, and breathing out the waste-air that comes from this emotional body part. This technique also works on self-satotaging memories and beliefs that evoke emotion as you remember it.</p>
        
                <h4 align="middle" class="S1Q"><p>Focus on the emotion-inducing thoughts or memories to intentionally evoke the emotion.<br> What emotion do you feel now and where do you feel it most prominently in your body?</p></h4>

                <h4 align="middle" class="S1Q"><p>Now try breathing into that body part to 'clean out' the emotional body part.<br> What happens to your emotion and thoughts every time you breath in and out?<br> How many breaths does it take for you to notice the effect of this technique?</p></h4>

                <h6 align="middle">It may help imagine the cool air you breath into the body part as a 'cleasing purifying fluid'<br>for the negative emotion the hot air your breath out from the body part as a 'toxic waste gas'.</h6>
