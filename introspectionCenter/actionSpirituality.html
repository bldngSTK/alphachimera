            <b>Origin of Action</b>
            <br><br>
            Action originates from 3 places, instinct (automatic reflexes that don't require practice, Ex: A newborn dog can be dropped in a pool of water and still swim, a newborn baby naturally knows how to drink milk and swallow), training (repetitively practicing an action forms a habit where the action becomes automatic), and from thoughts (Ex: the action of 'eating food' originates from 'thinking about food', the action of 'consuming content' originates from 'thinking about content'). We oftentimes focus on the externally observable outcomes of actions (grades) instead the thoughts that birthed the actions itself (understanding the subject), but motivation can be improved by strengthening the our mind's focus on those thoughts themselves.

            <br><br>Persistently holding onto one thought in the mind over an extended period of time results in what other people externally see as 'motivation'. The most successful 'disciplined' people are the ones able to hold particular thoughts in their mind, and as they hold onto those thoughts in their mind, their actions start following though and moving in the same direction. By concentrating our mind on a single thought, we can actually end up achieving and attaining so much more effectively than if we were distracted by multiple thoughts (Ex: With New Years resolutions, people seem highly motivated to accomplish their resolutions at the beginning of the year because they are thinking about it a lot, but as time goes by and theres fluctuations in what thoughts their mind focuses on, thoughts that cause them to lose motivation start trickling in, making them stop thinking about accomplishing their resolutions because they started thinking about other things.) Motivation is the result of a concentrated one-pointed mind on these actionable thoughts, and the more we train our mind to focus on 1 point, the more our mind obeys in doing actions by keeping our focus on thoughts of those actions.  Even for people who are 'too motivated' or 'addicted' to certain behaviors, the unhealthy actions actually cultivated from focusing on those 'addiction-inducing thoughts' (Ex: If I'm struggling to play less videogames, it really hard to resist the motivation to play the game if my mind constantly gets bombarded with unwanted thoughts of the videogame anytime I try to do anything else). Unfortunately, not many of us actually learn how to focus, what to do when you get distracted, and how to resist impulses to avoid autopilot (<a href="../meditationCenter/thoughtControl.html">Relevant Meditation Technique</a>).
            <br><br>
            <b>Origin of Thoughts</b>
            <br><br>The origin of action is focusing on thoughts, and the origin of all thoughts (right thoughts or wrong thoughts) are sensory impressions tied to some emotional impact, whether that's in the present or from past memories. Something has to enter our consciousness via our sense organs and also have some kind of emotional significance attached to it in order for us to be thinking about it (Ex: The motivation of me wanting to watch a particular movie originated from my memories of my sense organs with me one day hearing about the movie and then feeling excited about the movie, people 100 years ago weren't thinking about the movie because they'd never heard of it, which doesn't let them get emotionally impacted by it. The goal of 'advertising' is to populate our mind with particular thoughts via particular emotional sensory input to try motivating us into buying particular things.)
            <br><br>The origin of all thoughts is some kind of sensory input, so if we're careful about controlling our sense organs, we can cultivate the right kinds of thoughts that shape our behavior in the right ways (Ex: If our goal is to 'get sober from alcohol', spending time at bars with people drinking will make sobriety hard to achieve because the sensory input from the bar will create thoughts of alcohol, and the fundamental difference between a bar and an AA meeting is that we sensorically get exposed to different things by hearing/smelling/tasting different things.) Environment is a group of sensory impressions, and cultivating the right environment can create good sensory impressions, thereby positively altering our thoughts, thereby positively shaping our behavior and motivation. ('Startup incubators' are environments with sensory impressions that continuously create thoughts of excitement about startups, ultimately motivating people to work on startups). It's not necessarily the environment itself that creates the thoughts but more specifically the emotionally-impactful sensory impressions that come with the environment that end up making the thought.
            <br><br>Thoughts don't come from just pure sensory impressions, but with the emotions attached to the sensory impressions. (Ex: Children who grow up in toxic households oftentimes hear particular mean words, and even though the mean words are ultimately just words, they attach particular emotions like 'shame' and 'guilt' to that sensory stimulus of 'mean words', thereby allowing it to get laid down in their memory and generate thoughts like 'I'm a bad person'.) Even though fundamentally all sensory impressions are just simple objective observations of particles and energy waves (molecules with sound waves, photons with light waves, etc) we oftentimes associate sensory impressions with some kind of emotions <!--(due to some internal subjective expectations),--> and that association of 'objective sensory impression + subjective emotional impact on us' is actually what creates thoughts. If I'm a fully-grown adult and someone calls me an idiot, that sensory input can be exactly the same whether I'm an adult or a child, but the emotional impact of that sensory input of hearing "You're an idiot" can be different for the adult and the child, and can end up creating different thoughts depending on if I'm an adult or child.
            <br><br>When a sensory impression gets attached to an emotional impact and then gets laid down into our memory, it will generate different kinds of thoughts (like a thought-generating machine) depending on what the emotional impact of the sensory impression was. Future sensory stimuli that's similar to the original sensory impression can trigger an echo of those emotional thoughts and can in-turn start shaping our behavior and motivation in different ways throughout our life. When a child grows up being repetitively told "You're an amazing person, you can do anything you want, you're the best person ever", etc, that emotional sensory stimuli may cause the child to grow up feeling arrogant, entitled, and spoiled. On the flipside, if a child is told "You're the worst person ever, you can't do anything", etc, that emotional sensory stimuli may cause the child to grow up feeling inadequate, worthless, and insecure. These people can then grow up having thoughts like 'I definitely deserve this' or 'I don't deserve this', which can then shape their behavior and motivation when it comes actions like 'applying for a promotion', 'asking someone out on a date', etc, because they may feel extremely entitled or super undeserving to that promotion or date.
            <br><br>
            <b>Sensory Control</b>
            <br><br>Action doesn't just come from thoughts, but more specifically our ability to persistently focus on particular thoughts over an extended period of time, so understanding how to focus on thoughts can significantly improve our motivation. If we're trying to pay attention to something, being distracted by various sensory input (like sounds, smell, etc) will make it harder for us to focus on that thing. The more we fracture and distribute our attention throughout our 5 senses, the more diluted and weaker the action caused by our attention becomes (if we're studying a textbook and watching a show at the same time, we don't get much productive studying done and we also don't properly grasp whats happening in the show), and the more our attention is devoted to less sensory organs, the more powerful our attention to that sense organ becomes, and the more exponentially we're able to accomplish (food is more enjoyable if we're not distracting by watching or listening to something else, listening to music with our eyes closed increases our enjoyment of the music). The more distracted we get by different sensory stimuli, the less productive we are, so controlling our sense organs can control our attention, and then our controlled attention can be directed in a particular way to yield positive results.
            <br><br>We feel boredom when we don't have any external sensory stimuli to occupy our mind, so we look for some kind of external sensory stimuli to help push our attention in a particular direction. But retreating from boredom via some external sensory stimuli can be problematic because rather than controlling our sensory organs to control our attention where we want it to be, we start relying on some external sensory stimuli (drugs, technology, videogames, etc) as a crutch to pull my attention in a particular way, and as we become more vulnerable to boredom by losing control of our attention since we're relying on a crutch, we start losing control of our motivation (Ex: I feel bored, so I will open this app so that I can let that app pull my attention automatically like an external crutch, and as I rely on the crutch to pull my attention more instead of contolling my attention myself, I start losing controlling of my own attention. This puts me in a vicious cycle where I can't tell the attention of my mind what to do and I get more bored and distracted, causing me to rely on external crutches more and more to alleviate that boredom.)
