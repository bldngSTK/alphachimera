    <h1 align="middle">Solutions of Worrying</h1>
    <p>There are 3 solutions to stop suffering from worry: An in-the-moment solution, a long term solution, and a difficult but powerful 'spritual' solution inspired by the philosophies of eastern meditative worldviews.</p>
    <p class="S1H"><b>Bringing Mind to Present (In-The-Moment Solution, Compassionate Self-Talk)</b></p>
        <p>Awareness precedes self-control, and all you need to do to control something you do is become aware of it. If you used to control something, but then lose awareness of it, your control of it then goes away as well, and it returns once you can start feeling and becoming aware of it again. (Ex: When you become aware how you're breathing, then you start to control your breath. The use of anesthetics numbs your awareness of a particular body part, thereby removing your control, and once the anesthetics wear off, your awareness of it comes back, and your control over it returns as a result.)
        Worry cannot cognitively exist when the mind is focused on the present, so cultivating the capacity for awareness of noticing the anxious thought processes and their responsive actions presently occuring can literally deflate the worried mental state entirely. When you're worried about something, you feel lost and caught up in your anxious thought process, but if you can take a step back from it all by simply starting to become aware of what all your thoughts are, you start to feel less caught up in it and your entire anxiety will start to calm down.</p>
        <p class="S1Q">1. What is the speed of your thoughts and mind? What you are worried about? Does your mind want to naturally respond in an unhealthy way? (Distraction, Avoidance, Seeking Reassurance, Fighting our Mind).</p>
        <textarea class="S1A" rows="5" cols="27" align="middle"type="text"></textarea><br><!--every answer has class="S1A" --> 
        <font size="1" >My mind is thinking about many negative outcomes and moving very rapidly. I am worried about riding these terrifying roller coasters. My mind naturally wants to avoid the roller coasters and go to a different part of the amusement park , or even make up some excuse to just go home entirely.</font><br>
        <p class="S1Q">2. How is your worry unreasonable (or is it actually reasonable)? How would you talk to a friend going through your situation (and sympathize with them but still not let them give into their worries so easily)?</p>
        <textarea class="S1A" rows="5" cols="27" align="middle"type="text"></textarea><br><!--every answer has class="S1A" --> 
        <font size="1" >My worry is unreasonable because thousands of people have rode these very same rides all-year-round and these roller coasters have never failed them before. If a friend was going through this, I would tell them "It seems really scary and we don't really know for sure if the ride will be safe because it could technically still snap at any moment, it sucks that such a good ride could potentially go catastrophic. But even though the rides are scary, you should still go because you might regret missing out on all this fun later, and you already paid for the amusement park tickets so might as well see how the ride is. Sometimes the scariness of the ride can be a part of what makes it fun, enjoyable, and a more thrilling experience."</font><br>
        <p class-"S1Q">3. If you've been worried about this before, what usually ends up happening (Were you able to come out the other end okay)? How can you reassure yourself based on prior experiences?</p>
        <textarea class="S1A" rows="5" cols="27" align="middle"type="text"></textarea><br><!--every answer has class="S1A" --> 
        <font size="1" >I've been worried about riding roller coaster rides last summer too, and last time my friends forced me to go with them. The ride itself was completely terrifying and scary all-throughout, but afterwards I felt so relieved and happy that it was over, and even though it was scary, I was still able to survive that fear and the roller coaster. I can reassure myself by remembering that nothing bad happened last time, and even though I may have heard some concerning creaks and clicks, those creepy sounds didn't actually mean anything because I was able to safely experience the entire ride.</font><br>

        <p class="S2H"><b>Digesting Roots of the Worry (Long-Term Solution, Metabolize Specific Samskaras)</b></p>
        <p>'Anxiety' is often treated like a generic monolithic term, but different people get worried about different things, and the roots of what someone's mind chooses to worry about is often unique and individualized to them. Not everyone gets worried about the same thing because each person's anxiety is a learned response that their mind is taught to produce as a result of their own individual circumstances, often-times rooted in past experiences that create expectations and rewire the way our mind views those circumstances going forward, potentially becoming inappropriately maladaptively protective. Worrying is our brain's way of protecting us from being hurt again by wiring for particular insecurities to trigger when familiar situations arise to avoid those same negative outcomes from reoccuring. (Getting bullied may teach you that 'being seen is dangerous' and leads to trouble socializing later down the road, 'relationship baggage' is when experiencing a bad relationship in the past shapes the way you look at yourself and future relationships going forward and could sometimes cause you to view benign signs in later relationships as 'dangerous signals your partner will absolutely do something wrong' when in-reality they won't, etc.)
        <p>'Samskara' is Sanrkit for 'lesson' or 'memory', and is an accumulation of undigested emotional energy from past experiences that usually lies dormant in our mind but can activate at particular triggering situations and familiar circumstances. Samskaras are our mind's beliefs of how to easily navigate the different circumstances life throws at us by removing the burden of repetitive cognitive processing. (Ex: If I had amnesia of every single toilet I've ever used, I would get extremely lost and confused anytime I see a new toilet, but remembering my samskara-belief of previous toilet experiences makes it super easy to use new toilets that I've never even seen before.) We have samskara-beliefs of our sense-of-self ("I believe I am a good person because I remember my actions causing good outcomes"), of other people ("I believe people are fundamentally trustworthy because I remember people always making me happy and never causing me suffering"), and of how to interact with the world ("I believe I know how to use this toilet even though I've never used this specific toilet before because I've used other toilets that look similar"). Our mind may think that automatically removing the burden of cognitive processing with samskaras is always effective, and even though oftentimes it is very useful and healthy, it can sometimes be self-sabotaging and maladaptively protective (especially in the case of inappropriate worrying), and understanding how the samskara was formed can us help figure out how to digest and process what the root of our worrying is. Sometimes finding the Samskara can be easy because you can remember one big macroscopic 'traumatic' event with lots of emotional energy attached to it, but sometimes the Samskara could be more difficult to find because it's caused by a slow build up of many tiny little emotional experiences that pile up over a long period of time and don't get processed. The more you bring out that emotional energy and feel it in the present rather than distracting yourself from it (by externally distracting yourself with technology, intellectually analyzing it with logic, beating yourself up or getting caught up in thoughts that create new emotional energy, etc), the faster the memories get digested and the cleaner your mind will feel afterwards.</p>

        <p class="S1H"><b>Ego Dissolution & Surrender Outcome (Permanent Spiritual Solution, Detachment of Self + Devotion to Action)</b></p>
        <p><u>Ego Dissolution: </u>Worrying is rooted in our Ego or sense-of-self, and the dangers our mind gets worried about is always a potential consequence to our self. Anxiety is all about 'you not wanting and not being okay with bad things happening to you', sometimes selfishly or egotistically in an entitled or spoiled manner. (Ex: If 'you want to go to a party' but you are worried that 'you might look like a loser' the consequence of 'you might look like a loser' matters to you because you are not okay with 'you coming off as a loser'. If 'you want to raise your hand in class to answer the teachers question' but are worried 'you might get the question wrong and then everyone might think you're stupid', the consequence of 'you might get the question wrong' matters to you because you don't want 'a reputation of you being stupid'). The consequences your worried mind is trying to avoid always has to do with 'you', so if you weren't so caught up in your Ego with what you don't want for yourself and can be okay with whatever could happen to you, you become completely free from worries.
        Once we understand how to remove our 'self' from our worried thought processes, then we can take any action that our anxious mind restricts us from taking, because the more our mind thinks "Oh no, what about me?", the more we get held back from doing any action where the outcome could negatively impact us to even the slightest degree.
        'Ego Dissolution' is when the opinions of other people (or even my opinion of my self) doesn't really matter because we already know who we are and we don't need any external reassurance if we already are confident in who we are and believe in ourself, and we start moving from being a person that's concerned with who they are to simply existing and living life.
        <p><u>Surrender Outcome: </u> Worrying arises when we are uncertain about what negative outcomes may happen in the future, and we try to control future outcomes in a particular ideal way to remove that uncertainty entirely and prevent those disliked outcomes from actually happening i.e. 'If you can control the future, you won't have to worry about bad outcomes happening to you anymore'. (Ex: The uncertainty of 'might look dumb at a party' can be removed and controlled into being a certainly liked outcome if 'I avoid going to the party entirely'.) Anxiety is rooted in our desire to control negative outcomes from happening, but if we can learn to surrender to whatever the outcome may be, our anxiety goes away completely. Worrying is when our mind says 'If you do this, this negative outcome might happen', and surrendering is telling our mind 'So be it'. The concept of surrendering can be terrifying because it's the exact opposite of what our worried mind wants us to do, but it's the only way to let go of worrying completely, and if our worried mind is telling us 'This bad thing might happen', we simply let it end up happening and surrender to it. (Ex: Our worries may say 'If you don't study tonight, you'll fail, and even though you've studied all week, you'll still fail', and a surrendering attitude is telling our mind 'This is as much as I'm going to study, and if I fail, so be it'. Our worries may say 'If you go to the gym, people might think you're overweight and out-of-shape', and a surrendering attitude is being able to tell ourselves 'So be it, if that's what people will think, let them think it, I surrender'). Suffering in life comes from 'a human being's desire to control the outcomes of their actions', but humans can't actually control any of the outcomes of their actions, they can only control the actions themselves (which may sometimes influence the outcomes in a particular way, but not necessarily control it absolutely). But a worried mindset tries to directly control the outcome itself (Ex: 'I will think about what kind of clothing I should wear to control the thoughts of other people about my appearance', 'I won't go to the gym when I'm out-of-shape to control other people's responses to me".) Worrying is all about directly controlling outcomes in the outside world, and your mind spends so much time and energy to give you that guarantee of you having the outcome you want ('You won't look stupid', 'People won't make fun of you', etc.) but the ability to control a single outcome in a single circumstance is something you can never obtain. Rather than being caught of in the outcomes of our actions, we can instead devote ourselves to only the actions themselves and surrender the outcome to whatever external entity we want (the universe, Karma, circumstances, God, entropy, cause-and-effect, etc), because as a human being, I can't actually control what ends up happening. (Ex: As a student, I can't actually 'pass or fail a test' because I do not control whether I 'pass or fail a test', all I can actually do is study, show up, and answer every question. As a doctor, I cannot 'save a patients life' because the outcome of 'patient living' is ultimately out of my control, all I can actually control is what I do, which is to assess the situation, diagnose appropriately, and give proper treatment.) Once we realize that we can't control the outcomes of our actions and can only control the actions themselves, then we start to understand how to surrender the outcomes and devote ourself to focusing on the actionable deeds only, and our happiness and suffering in life stops becoming dependent on outcomes we can't control and instead becomes dependent on the actions we devote ourselves to and can control. Worrying can problematically cripple our lives by keeping us from acting and paralyzing us, and we can't do what we want to do because our worries constantly produce thoughts like "Oh no this might go wrong, We better not do it..." Ironically the more we try control our lives, the more we actually lose our freedom to worries that want to prevent disliked outcomes that might unideally affect us in some way from happening, but if we surrender the outcome, devote ourselves to the actions, and can be okay with whatever could happen to us, paradoxically letting go of control of our life is how we actually gain power over our life.</p>
        <p class="S3Q">1. What are you worried about, what disliked outcomes could come with it, and how could those disliked outcomes negatively effect you?</p>

        <font size="1" >I'm worried about people noticing me and scrutinizing me in social situations. The disliked outcomes that could come with this are people seeing something bad, thinking I'm stupid, or thinking I'm messing something up. These outcomes could negatively effect me because people could reject/offend me, or even embarrass/humiliate me.</font><br>
        <p class="S3Q">2. On a scale of 1-10, how much are you not okay with those negative things happening to you, and why?</p>

        <font size="1" >On a scale of 1-10, I dislike people rejecting me, offending me, embarrassing me, and humiliating me at an 8/10. This is because it heavily bothers me when I think people don't like me, but a small part of me knows and accepts that I will still be okay even if people don't like me.</font><br>
        <p class="S3Q">3. How do your worried thoughts try to control and avoid the uncertainty of those disliked outcomes from happening and make it a certainty that you're okay with?</p>

        <font size="1" >My worried thoughts try to control and avoid the uncertainty of 'people seeing something bad, thinking I'm stupid, or thinking I'm messing something up' by pushing me to avoid situations that require social contact and stay at home playing videogames, because then no one can dislike me and that's a certainty I am okay with.</font><br>
        <p class="S3Q">4. What is the outcome your mind truly desires to have, and why can't you control this desired outcome to ever happen?</p>
        <textarea class="S3A" rows="5" cols="27" align="middle"type="text"></textarea><br> <!--every answer has class="S1A" --> 
        <font size="1" >The outcome my mind truly desires to have is 'everyone liking/accepting me and no one finding any flaws in me'. I can't every truly control this outcome to happen because as a human being, I can't ever truly control a single thought in a single person's mind, and it's arrogant to think that I can.</font><br>
        <p class="S3Q">5. Instead of desiring a particular uncontrollable outcome, what controllable actions can you choose to devote yourself to, and what external entity or concept can you surrender the uncontrollable outcome to?</p>
        <textarea class="S3A" rows="5" cols="27" align="middle"type="text"></textarea><br> <!--every answer has class="S1A" --> 
        <font size="1" >Instead of desiring the uncontrollable outcome of 'everyone liking me', the controllable actions I can devote myself to are 'saying what I'm thinking of wanting to say as clearly as needed, actively listening to what other people are saying, and responding how I want to respond'. The external concept I'm choosing to surrender the uncontrollable outcome of 'everyone liking me' is to all of my life's circumstances that are out of my control.</font><br>
        <p class="S3Q">6. What does your happiness or suffering with the situation now depend on, and what do you think about not getting the uncontrollable outcome you want despite devoting yourself to action?<br></p>
        <textarea class="S3A" rows="5" cols="27" align="middle"type="text"></textarea><br> <!--every answer has class="S1A" --> 
        <font size="1" >My happiness/suffering with the situation depends on how well I 'say what I'm thinking of wanting to say as clearly as needed, actively listen to what other people are saying, and respond what I want to respond'. If I don't get the uncontrollable outcome of 'everyone liking me', so be it, I did the best I could given all my circumstances.</font><br>
        <p class="S3Q">7. Now that you've decided to devote yourself to action, how much are you not okay with those negative things happening to you that you stated in (1) on a scale from 1-10, and why?<br></p>

        <font size="1" >On a scale of 1-10, I dislike people rejecting/offending/embarrassing/humiliating me at a 2/10. This is because I don't care about external people rejecting me and saying I'm not likable since I already internally know that I'm doing the best I can given my circumstances, but a small part of me still wishes they would like me.</font><br>
