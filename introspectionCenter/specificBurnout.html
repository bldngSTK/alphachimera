            Burnout is different from standard tiredness, stress, 'laziness', and feeling bad because burnout is always work-related and arises from 6 synergistic hybrid-problems that are caused by the intersection of the individual (controllable) and the workplace (influencable). Burnout makes us have a lack of energy (low excitement, time feels flat), lack of empathy (stops caring about others, fatalistically cynicical remarks/beliefs), and a lack of enjoyment (job doesn't feel fulfilling). 'Burnout' also implies a sense of 'permanently drained', but a discrepancy between an individual and the workplace in 6 different factors cause burnout and resolving these 6 discrepancy factors causes the burnout to naturally melt away.
