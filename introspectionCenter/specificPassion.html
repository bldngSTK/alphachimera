        Sometimes we feel meaningless, purposeless, and don't really know what we want to do with our free time, causing us to gravitate towards fun easy-reward dopaminergic activities to pass some time. Purpose can't be objectively given to us because our sense of purpose is something that subjectively 'comes from within', and since we excessively try to externalize our attention through our 5 senses (using phone during toilet breaks, music while walking, etc) instead of being somewhat attentional to our internal signals and being in touch with ourselves, we start to numb our internal signals of what we subjectively want, making us struggle to find a purpose for our time. The main reason we numb our internal signals in the first place is because the first layer of internal voice is usually suppressed negative emotions (worrying before bed, sadness while showering, boredom while waiting, etc), but the more we stop numbing our internal signals of our subjective values and goals, the more we start having an individualized sense of direction of how we want to be productive, and difficult things that are aligned with our internal productive impulses start becoming 'worth it' and easier to accomplish.
        <br><br>
        The 'Productivity Turning Point' is when our natural internal impulse to be productive starts outweighing our natural impulse to dopaminergically waste time and procrastinate. Before we reach this Productivity Turning Point, we may easily spend hours on some sort of 'useless' activity (virtual videogame achievements, social media likes, YouTube content, etc) but struggle to consistently be productive. It can be confusing because anytime we are productive we actually feel really good (satisfied, content, proud, fulfilled, etc) and anytime we waste time we feel really bad (empty, guilty, regretful, ashamed, etc), but even though being productive feels good afterwards and wasting time feels bad afterwards, we still struggle to be productive. Many of us feel like 'productivity' is a temporary state that will inevitablely end because the desire to addictively waste our time will eventually win, but once we reach our Productivity Turning Point, we no longer have to resist the urge to waste time because the desire to be productive starts to become stronger than the desire to do something unproductive, and being productive starts becoming natural and easy. The 3 steps to reaching the 'Productivity Turning Point' are tolerating boredom, capturing our creative impulses by producing work, and then reflecting on our creative work.
        <br><br>
        <b>1. Tolerate boredom</b><br>Whenever we're bored, our mind desires some kind of stimulation and usually tries reaching for some kind of external dopaminergic easy-reward activity to satisfy that boredom. But resolving the boredom with dopaminergic activities will reduce the need for our mind to produce creative ideas to satisfy that boredom, and if we're able to resist/survive/procrastinate-on that boredom by not satisfying it with a dopaminergic activity, staying bored long enough will cause our mind to start thinking creatively. When we're doing a boring activity (taking a shower, going for a walk, going on a hike, going to the restroom, etc) without sensory stimuli to satisfy boredom (not watching/listening to videos, podcasts, music, etc), all kinds of creative thoughts will eventually start to arise from our mind to satisfy that boredom and we start getting creative impulses to do productive things (shower thoughts, pondering on walks, revelations while going on a hike, etc.) We may even find ourselves in a cycle where the more we're able to resist the impulse to satisfy boredom with some easy-reward behavior, the more creatively we start to think, and the more creative ideas we produce, the more the amount of boredom we need resist starts shrinking (I used to need to resist boredom for 60 seconds, but now I just need to wait 30 seconds for creative ideas to be produced, because my brain starts to learn 'I don't need to do that dopaminergic activity anymore, I'll just go straight to the creative impulse'.)
        <br><br>
        <b>2. Capture your creative impulses
        </b><br>After we tolerate the boredom and start getting creative impulses, we can then capture those creative impulses by producing it in some kind of sensory medium (Ex: jotting down fictional story ideas, creating layout plans for business ideas, doodling artwork ideas, plannig out music ideas, storyboarding video ideas, etc.) Oftentimes whenever we have a creative impulse to do something or make some, we sometimes don't turn it into anything, making the idea come and then go away. By capturing whatever fleeting creative impulses we have, we can capitalize on this creativity by pushing us towards reaching the 'Productivity Turning Point', and even if we find a single piece of creative impulse 'fruit', we can harness those 'seeds' rather than letting them go by 'planting' them for future use.
        <br><br>
        <b>3. Reflect on your creative work</b><br>Doing an action over and over again doesn't always improve our performance in it, but learning from our past mistakes and successes can significantly improve our performance. (Ex: I can be stuck at Bronze Rank in League of Legends for years despite constantly playing, but once I do replay analysis on my games by intentionally looking at what I did wrong to try improving it, my rank will improve. Gaining more experience as a doctor doesn't make you a good doctor because doctors practicing for 40 years can underperform doctors practicing for 3 years, the doctors who learn from their past successes and failures perform the best while the doctors who do the bare minumum status quo without ever learning from their past performance perform the worst.) Normally nothing comes out of our captured creative impulse, but by looking at and reflecting on our previous work, we can start improving our overall skill and also start sparking new ideas. Even if we don't feel like being productive, we can be inspired to work again by simply reflecting on our previous creative work, because whatever we bombard our senses with will be what we naturally think about, and exposing ourself to our previous work can rekindle that previous excitement and create thoughts of productivity (If I start watching YouTube, that will trigger a particular train of thoughts, and if I look at my previous drawings, that will trigger a different train of thoughts). By reflecting and bombarding our senses and mind with productive creative thoughts by tolerating boredom and reflecting on our work instead of wasting time by, we eventually reach our 'Productivity Turning Point' where instead of wanting to waste our time with dopaminergic easy-reward activities, we actually start to want to be productive.
