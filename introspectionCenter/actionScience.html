            'Motivation' often gets confused with 'forcing yourself to do something' (discipline, self-control, will power, etc.), but what we need to cultivate is an intrinsic desire to do something where we don't have to force ourself to do anything. Different parts of the brain are responsible for creating that intrinsic desire, and if a part of our brain isn't functioning ideally, it will create some obstacle for us having that intrinsic desire. As we start to understand the system of how the human brain decides to do something, we can start to control motivation by developing a plan for fixing motivational problems.

            <b>Action-Success Formula</b>
            <br><br>
            Motivation is an ongoing 'Action-Success' calculation in our brain that's constantly changing, not a static quality. We often struggle with problems like follow-through, procrastination, or unconfidence, but understanding the subtleties of this equation makes all of these experiences clear. The Action-Success calcuation is made up of 3 components, 'benefit' (the upsides from engaging in the behavior), 'cost' (the downsides of engaging in the behavior), and 'likelihood of success' (how likely or unlikely it is for the behavior to succeed).
            <br><br>Benefit can negatively influence our motivation because our brain responds to understood experiences of the reward, not intellectual ideas or logical hypotheticals of what the reward could be. (Ex: The benefit of 'quitting smoking at the age of 21' is 'I avoid heart-disease and stroked at the age of 60', or the benefit of 'exercise' is 'I feel better in 6 months, see physical changes in 1 year, and prevent health issues in 40 years', but our brain only reinforces behavior that had some kind of reward attached to engaging in that behavior afterwards). When the benefit gets realized so far after engaging in the behavior, it's hard for our brain to engage in the behavior, and if our sense of reward is some idea that hasn't been truly realized by us yet, we won't be able to find instrinsic motivation for it. Experiencing some kind of reward is how we increase our instrinsic motivation towards certain behaviors, because then our brain truly knows the benefit of engaging those behaviors.
            <br><br>Cost can negatively influence our motivation because overestimating the cost causes procrastination and underestimating the cost causes follow-through problems. When our brain overestimates the cost by assuming a cost that's too high, it decreases our motivation to engage in the behavior by procrastinating, and once we finally engage in the behavior, we may think afterward "Oh it wasn't that bad, I actually could've started earlier." Lowering our expectations of downsides to the appropriate cost can reduce our tendency to procrastinate. On the flipside, our brain may underestimate the cost of engaging in a behavior by assuming a cost that's too low and not properly acknowledging how bad engaging in the behavior can be by being too caught up in the reward, making us have trouble with follow-through (Ex: People abandon tasks like 'playing the guitar', 'learning a new language', 'participating in a club', etc, because they are too caught up in the benefit of 'sounding cool when I play the guitar', 'speaking this other language', and 'being productive at the the club', etc, and without properly acknowledging the downsides of 'fingers hurting when I play guitar', 'needing to spend lots of time to learn the language', 'club member responsibilities being overwhelming', etc). We abandon tasks by giving up and have trouble with follow-through when we underestimate the downsides by being caught up in the reward, so detaching from the reward by properly acknowledging what the cost may really be can fix follow-through problems.
            <br><br>The likelihood-of-success can negatively influence our motivation because if something has a high likelihood-of-success, our brain will be more motivated towards it, and if it has a low likelihood-of-success, our brain will be less motivated to doing it. Our brain assesses and determines the likelihood-of-success from confidence, and having a low state of confidence may create hopeless thoughts like 'Don't bother trying because it won't work, the likelihood of it working is 0', etc. Other people may reassuringly tell us to engage in the behavior because they can properly see the probability-of-success without the biased confidence, and we may even look for externalized solutions to fix our lack of motivation (signing up for a 'productivity course', taking 'motivation-boosting supplements', joining conferences and accountability groups, etc) instead looking within ourselves to fix the internal problem with confidence, but once we develop confidence (by thinking about our self-esteem, when we gained insecurity, etc), we can start directing the Action-Success Calculation towards being more motivated.

            <b>Reward Circuitry<br><br>        </b>
            Sometimes we get really excited about something like watching a show, and we'll sit down ready to have fun, but then we may catch ourself pulling out our phone while trying to watch the show at the same time, and our mind starts entering a blur where we're not even enjoying the show or our phone. So we'll try putting our phone away to focus on the show, but soon enough we're back scrolling through on our phone again. Dopaminergic activities (like technology) can start entering our life and interfering with our ability to do the right stuff where people often say things like "Instead of doing the work I should do, I spend time watching YouTube", "Instead of learning a new skill I want to get good at, I'm wasting 3 hours on Twitter", or "I feel addicted to videogames and social media", and lots of this can be explained via 'reward circuitry'.
            Our brain's mesolimbic circuit contains the 'reward circuitry' which governs our behavior with 'wanting' things, and the primary neurotransmitter in the reward circuitry is dopamine. This reward circuitry of 'wanting' is very different from our hedonic circuitry of 'liking' and 'enjoyment', because 'liking' and 'wanting' are not always the same thing. When we engage in a behavior and that behavior then leads to a reward, we learn that 'this behavior leads to this reward', making us reinforce that original behavior and want to do that behavior again. For example, If I eat cake for the first time (behavior) and I realize it's really tasty (reward), the behavior of 'eating cake' gets reinforced, making me learn to want to eat cake again. Dopamine and the reward circuitry also govern learning because learning is the process of reinforcing a behavior. For example, when a baby takes their first steps (behavior) and everyone starts clapping (reward), it encourages the baby to continue taking more steps and learn how to walk. 
                Motivational problems start arising when this reward circuitry gets tampered with. When we study hard for a test (behavior) and then get an A+ (reward), that reward of 'getting an A' reinforces the behavior of 'studying', but that reinforcement is much weaker compared to something like a substance of abuse that directly activates the chemicals of the reward circuitry in our brain, and the behavior of 'using the drug' becomes so powerfully reinforced that it overrides everything else. People addicted to substances (cocaine, marijuana, heroine, opiates, etc) often continuously face lots of negative consequences for engaging in the behavior of 'using the drug' (legal issues, relationship problems, financial troubles, etc) but despite all these negative consequences, they still continue engaging in the behavior of 'using the drug' because drugs directly stimulate our reward circuitry and make the brain think "I don't care about anything else, right now this is the only thing I want to do". Tampering with the reward circuitry also creates that impairment of learning too, because when we get addicted to something, we don't 'learn from our mistakes' (Ex: If we're super hung over throwing up from drinking heavily the previous night, we feel awful and promise to ourself 'I'll never touch alcohol again', but we don't actually learn that lesson because next week people start drinking again and we think 'I'll just be more careful this time'. No one wakes up excitedly saying "I can't wait to have a blast scrolling through Reddit for 8 hours today', and even after we spend excessive time with dopaminergic activities we often heavily regret it and say things like "I can't believe I wasted the entire day, forget about all the work I was supposed to do, I didn't even have fun today," and despite being filled with regret, we wake up the next morning and then doomscroll for 8 more hours.) We don't seem to learn from our mistakes despite the fact that we're making them over and over again, and oftentimes we don't even learn from our successes from certain behaviors as well. If we go to the gym (behavior) and feel really good about ourself afterward (reward), we'd think "Since I feel good about myself from exercising, that should reinforce the behavior of 'going to the gym' and I'll want to go to the gym again", but when our reward circuitry is tampered with, we won't properly reinforce that behavior with the reward, and no matter what happens, we'll never learn. Another addictive aspect of our dopaminergic activities are sometimes not even the reward and pleasure itself, but actually the emotional engagement of it. The content that rises to the top of media platforms is often the most negative-emotionally activating content (Negatively jarring content like retail workers facing injustice, police violence, tragedies around the world, etc. are often what people click on, doomscrollingly engage with, and upvote the most). We assume reward always has to be positive in some way, but the emotions our brain is most concerned about and biased with are the negative emotions, and negative emotions are much more powerful at shaping our behavior because when human beings evolved, the brains that didn't pay attention to negative things didn't survive. (Ex: I'll eat at my favorite restaurant 19 times in a row, but if I get food poisoning the 20th time, I won't calculate an accurate probability of '5% chance I'll get sick' and instead avoid the restaurant entirely.)
                <br><br>Dopaminergic activities tamper our reward circuitry through 'Tolerance', and when the brain recieves the same signal over and over again, it will homeostatically adjust and adapt to lower that signal by altering our default-baseline state accordingly (Ex: When I drink my first cup of coffee, my brain doesn't know what it is and how to deal with it so the coffee has a very powerful effect on me where I'm super wired and I stay up all night, but if I start drinking coffee on a regular basis, my brain starts adapting by reducing our baseline state so that I start needing more coffee to feel that same amount of high energy and not having any coffee makes me feel tired by default. If I've never had any alcohol before, 2 drinks may be enough to get me drunk, but if I start drinking everyday, my body develops tolerance and it can start requiring 6-12 drinks to get me drunk and not having any alcohol makes me feel worried, stressed, and sad by default, driving me to the alcohol further.) Along with things like caffeine and alcohol, our brain can start developing tolerance to reward and dopamine if we continuously engage in dopaminergic activities (Ex: The first 30 minutes of a show I watch is way more fun and engaging than the 12th hour of me binge-watching that same show because my brain starts developing tolerance to the show's enjoyment by hour 12. My first videogame session of the week is way more entertaining than the 18th hour I'm playing the same game on the weekend because my brain develops increases it's baseline-tolerance accordingly to the videogame's entertainment.) Even though the activity can stop being fun after we build tolerance to the enjoyment, we sometimes still struggle to stop, and high tolerance to reward may cause us to feel like we're stuck in a vicious cycle where using the activity isn't even fun anymore, but not engaging in the activity feels boring and awful, so the only way we can feel  our previously normal baseline state is by continuing to engage in the dopaminergic activity for longer and longer, building more and more tolerance along the way. Our motivation toward 'reading a book' is connected to 'playing 12 hours of a videogame' because the same brain's reward circuitry can be stimulated by getting an A+, opiates, or technology. The reward and pleasure from 'reading a book' is much less (from our brain's perspective) compared to something like 'watching TV', which still be much less compared to the easy reward of 'endlessly scrolling TikTok on our phone', and the more tolerance we build towards dopamine and pleasure, the more bored our brain becomes when engaging in any other activity where the enjoyment is below our new tolerance-altered pleasure-seeking baseline.
                <br><br>
                Domapine exhaustion is when our body fights the constant dopamine signal by numbing it's effect via homeostasis, and the easiest way to fix dopamine exhasution is to give the body time to heal and reset the numbing. The way to reset our reward circuitry and get rid of tolerance is via a 'Dopamine Detox' where we reduce the steady amount of dopaminergic reward we're constantly getting by abstaining from particular activities for about 10 days, and once our Tolerance goes away and our reward circuitry rebalances itself, we increase our ability to enjoy things, learn properly from actions, and reinforce the proper behaviors. A proper dopamine detox involves cutting out activities that give us easy access to that dopaminergic reward, such as substances (alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, etc), bad technology usage (excessive videogames, social media, doomscrollable content-aggregation sites like YouTube/TikTok/Reddit/Twitter, and constantly music listening), undesired sexual activities (pornography, masturbation, and unhealthy sex), unhealthy eating (craveable foods that combine carbohydrates with fats), unhealthy financial decisions (excessive in-person/online shopping and gambling), and other negative thrill-seeking behaviors (intentional reckless driving or street racing, dangerous impulsive stunts that can harm others or ourself, etc). As soon as we stop engaging in these easy-reward dopamenergic activities, we may start to unnumb and re-awake our emotional circuitry, so we can expect to feel more negative emotions (like boredom from small transient points of little stimulation, sadness from not preventing disliked past outcomes, worrying from the uncertainty of unwanted outcomes negatively affecting us, etc.) These negative emotions may drive us to relapse into the easy-reward activities even more, ultimately causing us to end the Dopamine Detox early and put us back at square one. The best way to deal with the arising negative emotions from a lack of dopaminergic activities is by preplanning and structuring the hours of our 10 days to be filled with various thoughtful and engaging activities that keep our mind from becoming too overwhelmed with the self-sabotaging negative emotions (like boredom, sadness, worry, etc). These thoughtful engaging activities can include anything with nature (hiking or fishing without technology, looking at sunsets/horizons, hanging near greenspace, going for a walk without music, etc), developing different skills we've wanted to learn (cooking and pre-planning to prevent from craving unhealthy food, reading books despite in-spite of a wandering attention, etc), stuctured socialized activities (away from people who excessively drink, play videogames, smoke, etc, and towards people who are more into things like escape rooms, boardgame nights, barbequeing together, and other enjoyable activities that can easily kill time), or even focus on our responsibilities and values (like managing our worklife-situations, studying and finishing school work earlier, going to the gym, making progress on passion projects, etc.) Another tool that can be helpful for Dopamine Detox is Urge Surfing, and our mind may start having powerful urges to engage with relapsing activities (use phone, masturbate, get high, etc), but it doesn't want that thing constantly forever, in-fact it often want to move on to a different desire. Urge surfing is the act of riding/surfing on top of the rising intense urge-wave, and as long we don't give into the urge, the urge-wave crashes down on its own, because in the same way our mind gets bored of a book or lecture, it will also get bored of the unhealthy urges. We don't even need to conquer these temporary urges because all we need to do is not give in to them by surfing right on the surface of the urge, and the urge will eventually go away. The cool thing about dopamine detox is that even though the target goal is 10 days, the detox can start to get exponentially easier around day 5, and we may even find ourself preferring our 'Dopamine Detox' routine over our previous dopamenergically-heavy routine even after we reach day 10. If we successfully complete the Dopamine Detox, we'll be able to enjoy other things more and find motivation by reinforcing the proper behaviors.
