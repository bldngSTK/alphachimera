        <p>
        Sometimes we may face particular 'seemingly unsolvable' problems in our life where no matter how much we think about the cause of the problem and try different solutions, it just feels like nothing seems to work ('I've tried supplements, self-help books, dating coaches, life-hacks, exercising, etc, but no matter what I try, nothing works'.) But sometimes the most effective way forward isn't to think about 'What am I doing wrong, what do I need to solve and fix?' but instead to think about 'When did I do it right, how did I do it right, and how can I replicate that success?'. We often think 'How can I not screw up?' and look into the problem, instead of thinking 'If this problem feels so unsolvable, why isn't every single human being struggling with this problem?' and looking into people who don't have this problem.
        <br><br>
        <b>Positive deviance</b> says 'Anytime there is a problem, we don't need to go looking for a new solution because a solution already exists, all we need to do is become aware of it and then duplicate it'. If you've tried lots of different solutions to fix a problem and none of them seem to work, you actually may not need any new solutions, and instead of focusing on the days you screwed up and current failures, try to focus on understanding the days you did really well and then duplicating those previous successes. Instead of focusing on what causes us to fail, we can try to understand and duplicate that which causes us to succeed. ('Whenever I study, I'm focusing on the problems I'm getting wrong, but what are all the factors for why I'm getting most of these questions right, what's going on in my mind that leads to these right answers?', 'Instead of worrying about what's causing me to relapse addictively drinking, why is it that I am not drinking on this day?', etc.)
