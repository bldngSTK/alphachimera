            <b>What is Meditation?</b>
            A lot of people hear the word 'meditation' and will often think it's this "awkward, cringey, intimate, super-hokey, self-help feel-good" kinda thing that you do to "feel better", and while there certainly are some benefits to meditation, the first important thing is to understand what the word meditation literally means (chances are there have been many times in your life where you've actually been frequently meditating for a long time but just haven't realized it yet), and a lot of the weirdness and uncomfortableness around meditation goes away once we understand what it is.
            Meditation was invented by a group of people in India who spoke a language called Sanskrit about 10,000 years ago, and the people who developed the science and practice of meditation don't use one word to describe it (similar to how Eskimos have dozens of words to describe snow because they have a very nuanced understanding about the topic).
            There's a lot of the confusion about meditation is because there's actually 3 Sanskrit words that all get translated to English as meditation: Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi.

          <p><b>Dharana:</b>
            verb or action you can do, translates to focusing/concentrating/technique, and are focusing methods for our mind. (Examples of Dharanas: focusing on breath, following a guided meditation, repeatedly chanting a phrase, doing a sound based technique, etc.).  The mind can't actually 'stop thinking about something', it can only be redirected onto something else. (Ex: If my mind is thinking about a videogame or feels like 'wasting time' on some pleasurable activity, I can't actually say 'stop thinking about this' to stop my mind, all I can do is redirect my attention to something else, like a textbook, and then my mind will follow along with it.) The goal of Dharana is to focus on one technique, and that in-turn pushes out all the prior thoughts and emotions in our head and puts our attention on the focusing technique. Some benefits of regularly practicing Dharana are improvements in focus and strenghtening the ability to start and follow-through with a task (like studying and motivation).

            <p><b>Dhyana:</b>
                noun (is something that happens to you, not something you can do) translates to no-mind state or meditative state. When a human keeps doing a Dharana for some time and gets lucky (irrespective of what kind of Dharana they do), then they'll end up finding themselves in Dhyana.
                Frequent meditators may say "Earlier I meditated and I had this great experience because everything was so peaceful and calming and I was really content with myself and I was in a completely different place..." but they are describing Dhyana (a state of mind they found themselves in), not Dhyana.
                Novice meditators get confused because they listen to what frequent meditators say, but when they try to enter that no-mind state, it's really disheartening and frustrated because your mind keeps getting distracted, won't sit still, keeps jumping around and getting bored, etc.
                But no one can actually do Dhyana (no-mind state), all they can literally do is Dharana (focusing technique), and if they do the Dharana for long enough, they may get lucky and find themselves in the calm state-of-mind known as Dhyana.
